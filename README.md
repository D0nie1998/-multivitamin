# Objectives & goals

Objectives for meditation mastery are:

1. For this website to be a stepping stone for people who want to learn meditation.
2. Have the most reliable and up to date information on the internet.
3. To be able to start a community which share the same goals.
4. Be able to work on all devices and being responsive in the process
5. Show all the benefits and all the people that have greatly benefited from this website.
6. Provide an easy to navigate web site.

I have big plans for this website in the next year and it excites me from what 2 months of learning html and css have taught me in this short space of time.

My goals for the future is:

1. Start a blog in the website where i can post information that people can see and interact with.
2. Add videos and tutorials on meditation to show people how to actually do it.
3. Add club and businesses  on to the page so i can show people where they are clubs to join so they can 
interact and meet like-minded people!
4. To be able to be recognised as one of the top meditation website and most reliable websites on the internet.
