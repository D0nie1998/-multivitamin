# Introduction

Meditation Mastery is a page that i have created for the purpose of trying to  get as much people as people as possible educated in the incredible amazing benefits of meditation. It has had a very big impact on my life so i hope that it can have an impact on many others.

This is the first website that i have created and i hope you can enjoy what you got to see, thanks for taking the time to read!

# Objectives & goals

Objectives for meditation mastery are:

1. For this website to be a stepping stone for people who want to learn meditation.
2. Have the most reliable and up to date information on the internet.
3. To be able to start a community which share the same goals.
4. Be able to work on all devices and being responsive in the process
5. Show all the benefits and all the people that have greatly benefited from this website.
6. Provide an easy to navigate web site.

I have big plans for this website in the next year and it excites me from what 2 months of learning html and css have taught me in this short space of time.

My goals for the future is:

1. Start a blog in the website where i can post information that people can see and interact with.
2. Add videos and tutorials on meditation to show people how to actually do it.
3. Add club and businesses  on to the page so i can show people where they are clubs to join so they can 
interact and meet like-minded people!
4. To be able to be recognised as one of the top meditation website and most reliable websites on the internet.

# Features
The website consists of three pages that are responsive, the pages are Home, Gallery and Sign Up.

## Home

### Logo and navigation bar
- For the logo i used google fonts to style the meditation mastery in an way that would catch the eye of the user as i feel that first impressions on a website go a long way in towards retention
- The navigation bar is responsive and easy to use in every device for the user to usr and navigate through the different websites

Getting it repsonsive was a challenging task for a beginner coder but the lessons i was taught from the lessons were very helpful 

### Why start Meditation
- In this section i added four of the most common benefits of meditation in a way that was easy to understand for the people reading.
- I took inspiration from the club ethos section for this task by spacing them evenly and also by using flex boxing instead of float.
- I experimented a lot with a color for the background but i found this color on a website so I tried it on this section and i thought it added a lot.

### Famous people who meditate
- For this part i searched three of the most famous people that i knew and admired so i could put them in for people who meditated.
- I again used flex-boxing for this as it made it easier to control the position of the information.
- The description of the people talked about who they were so that anyone who didnt know them could be briefly educated on who they were, then i found their insight on meditation and how it had helped them.

## Gallery
- In the gallery page I used about 16 images from different websites across the internet to show people how people do their meditation pose and the different cultures way of doing it.
- It is responsive and is easy to navigate through this website

## Sign up 
- The sign up page is a chance for people to sign up if they want to continue their journey into furthuring their understanding of meditation.
- I again took inspiration from the love running sign up page as it looked very impressive to me so i used that template with my own tweaks 

## Footer
- For the footer i used an easy and responsive design
